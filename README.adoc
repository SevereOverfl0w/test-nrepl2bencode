= Nrepl to Neovim communicator

Testing a way of communicating with both the nrepl & neovim via the bencode
socket to neovim msgpack rpc.

The benchmark is based on connecting to an nrepl, performing an evaluation, and
calling the Neovim function `Foo` with the result.

== Clojure

Clojure has challenges, due to it's startup time. However, following the advice
from https://github.com/kkinnear/zprint/blob/master/doc/filter.md[zprint
filter] I was able to reduce the total startup time to 0.8s, and the benchmark
took 1.8s, using the bootstrap classpath strategy.
